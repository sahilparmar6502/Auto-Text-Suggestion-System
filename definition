6. Text Autocomplete (Trie & Backtracking)
Implement an autocomplete feature using a Trie.
Enhance with backtracking to generate multiple suggestions.

- Implement Efficient Word Autocompletion
Develop an autocomplete system that predicts and suggests words based on user input using the Trie data structure.

- Optimize Search Using Trie
Store words efficiently in a Trie to enable fast prefix-based searching and retrieval of suggestions in O(N) time complexity.

- Enhance Autocompletion with Backtracking
Implement backtracking (DFS) to traverse the Trie and retrieve multiple word suggestions for a given prefix.

- Support Large Datasets Efficiently
Ensure the system can handle a large vocabulary (e.g., dictionaries, search history) without performance degradation.

- Enable Real-Time Suggestions
Implement real-time search where suggestions appear as the user types without noticeable delays.

- Provide a User-Friendly Interface (Optional)
If applicable, create a UI-based implementation (e.g., CLI or Web-based) for interactive word suggestions.

4. Auto-Correction for Misspellings
ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

If a user types a misspelled word (e.g., "hllo"), suggest "hello".
Implement a Levenshtein Distance or Edit Distance Algorithm.
ðŸ”¹ Implementation Idea:

Use Trie + Edit Distance Algorithm to find the closest match.
Highlight or correct mistakes automatically.

---------
5. Fuzzy Matching for Partial Inputs
ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

Allow suggestions even if the user misses characters (e.g., "aple" â†’ "apple").
Handle typos dynamically.
ðŸ”¹ Implementation Idea:

Use Trie + Fuzzy Search Algorithms like Damerau-Levenshtein Distance.
Allow wildcard searching (*pple matches apple).

6. Real-Time Suggestion with Fast Querying
ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

As the user types, show suggestions instantly without delays.
ðŸ”¹ Implementation Idea:

Use multi-threading or asynchronous processing for smooth performance.
Use Ternary Search Trees (TSTs) instead of a standard Trie for space efficiency.

-> Asynchronous Processing for Non-Blocking UI

ðŸ”¹ Why Asynchronous?

Instead of waiting for suggestions to load, users can continue typing while autocomplete runs in the background.
Improves responsiveness of applications.

Uses multi-threading or asynchronous event-driven programming to fetch suggestions without blocking the main user interface (UI).
Example:
While the user continues typing, suggestions update dynamically in the background.

In Python (for backend-based search): Use multi-threading or async frameworks like FastAPI.
